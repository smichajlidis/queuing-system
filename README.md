# Queue Management System with SFML

This project is a queue management system simulator developed using the SFML library. The system allows users to define queues, stations, and manage the flow of customers through the system. The simulator provides a graphical interface with windows for each station, a ticket printing kiosk, and a centralized screen displaying the status of all queues and stations.

## Features

- **Queue Creation**: Users can specify the number of queues needed and assign a topic and signature (single letter) to each queue.

- **Station Setup**: Users can define the number of stations and associate specific queues with each station.

- **Graphical Interface**: The system generates windows for each station, a ticket printing kiosk, and a centralized screen displaying the current status of all queues and stations.

- **Ticket Handling**: Stations have buttons for calling a ticket (green) and confirming the customer's presence (blue). The ticket on display alternates between being illuminated and blinking until confirmation.

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements**: Ensure you have SFML installed. You can download it [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).

2. **Build**: Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler.

3. **Run**: Execute the compiled executable to start the simulator.

4. **Usage**: Follow the on-screen prompts to set up the queues, stations, and observe the graphical interface.
